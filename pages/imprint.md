> This is a translation of the [German Impressum]({{site.baseurl}}/de/imprint), for information purposes only. Although every effort has been made to make the translation as accurate as possible, the legal interpretation of this translation could generate misunderstandings. Should this be the case, we encourage you to write to us to correct the translation and urge, in case of conflict, to take the original German document as a reference.

## Disclaimer - legal information
### § 1 Content warning

The free and freely accessible contents of this website have been created with the greatest possible care. However, the provider of this website does not guarantee the accuracy and actuality of the provided guides and news. Contributions identified by author name reflect the opinion of the respective author and not always the opinion of the provider. Calling up the free and freely accessible content alone does not establish any contractual relationship between the user and the provider; in this respect, the provider's intention to be legally bound is lacking.

### § 2 External links
This website contains links to third-party websites ("external links"). These websites are subject to the liability of the respective operators. When the external links were first created, the provider checked the external content for any legal violations. At that time, no legal violations were apparent. The provider has no influence on the current and future design and content of the linked pages. The inclusion of external links does not imply that the provider adopts the content behind the reference or link as its own. It is not reasonable for the provider to constantly monitor the external links without concrete evidence of legal violations. However, such external links will be deleted immediately if legal violations become known.

### § 3 Copyrights and ancillary copyrights
The content published on this website is subject to German copyright and ancillary copyright law. Any use not permitted by German copyright and ancillary copyright law requires the prior written consent of the provider or the respective rights' holder. This applies in particular to the copying, editing, translation, storage, processing or reproduction of content in databases or other electronic media and systems. Contents and rights of third parties are marked as such. The unauthorized reproduction or distribution of individual content or complete pages is not permitted and is punishable by law. Only the production of copies and downloads for personal, private and non-commercial use is permitted.

The display of this website in external frames is only permitted with written permission.

### § 4 Special terms of use
Insofar as special conditions for individual uses of this website deviate from the aforementioned paragraphs, this will be expressly pointed out at the appropriate place. In this case, the special terms of use apply in each individual case.

# Privacy Policy

> A Privacy policy is a legal document in which we describes how we process data, especially personal data. In Germany, as part of the EU, it's regulated by [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu). Even if our aim is not to store or process personal data information, we may need to do it, hence our privacy policy. "Personal data" is defined as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’)" (Art. 4.1) and "processing" as "any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction" (Art. 4.2).

To be transparent about our privacy policy ([Art 12 of GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/)), we need to diferentiate two cases: Navigating through the website and contributing to the website

## Navigating through the website
By navigating through the website we are referring to the activities (mainly acessing information) in [https://victor-fancelli-capdevila.github.io/abc_dl/](https://victor-fancelli-capdevila.github.io/abc_dl/) or subpages that have something after /abc_dl/, for example, [our imprint page at https://victor-fancelli-capdevila.github.io/abc_dl/imprint.html](https://victor-fancelli-capdevila.github.io/abc_dl/imprint.html).

Important here is:

### We don't track or profile you
We don't track or profile you in any way, nor we display ads or use this information to "improve our website": If you think that we should improve something in our website, make a contribution, open an issue or write us an email. That's exatcly what we are trying to achieve with this website.

### We don't send any newsletter, we don't have any social media profile
So we don't have to worry about it in our privacy policy.

### Forms in our website do not save persoanl data
You may encounter some forms in the website, for example a search bar or checkboxes: they do not save or send any information (nor personal or any other information) to us.

### Let's talk about (internet) cookies
Internet cookies are small files that your browser may download from a website and save in your computer or device, with some of your preferences or information to facilitate your navigation. When you navigate through internet, other webistes may see your cookies, and through them profiling you (recognizing you as a particular user or as part of a target group).

Cookies are important to make this website work and we are using it under [GDPR, Art. 6.1-f](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/):
> processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

You can manage or deactivate cookies in your browser (Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Brave, Internet Explorer or Edge, etc.), normally under preferences, security and privacy or something like that.

## Contributing to the website
By making a contribution to the website, we understand that you share any kind of information with us with the aim to be published. To do that, you may use different plattforms (github, moodle or nextcloud hosted in the university) that may use cookies or store your personal information.

### Check what you share with us: it will go public
We encourage you to check that the material you share with us does not contain any personal information that you don't want to make publicly available (that's especially relevant if you take screenshots). Even if we will check and modify (remove, obfuscate, etc.) that you are not sharing unnecessary personal data in the contentes, it's your responsability.

### The name of the contributor, the (only) personal data we're interested in
If you make a contribution, we will ask you to provide a name (it can be your full name, fist name, a nickname, etc), that we can put in our published list of contributors. The aim of this list is to show who contribute in this website, a kind of aknoledgment or recognition. There is no obligation in filling your name in the list: It's completely free and you can edit this list at any moment, or write us to do so.

### We use GitHub and they have their own privacy policies
We use GitHub Inc. or GitHub B.V. for managing version control of the contributions and hosting the website. [Here you can check the privacy policies of GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies). GitHub will save some personal information data and you should contact them if you have any issue or question.

This are valid when you are in the  [GitHub project's repository, which is https://github.com/victor-fancelli-capdevila/abc_dl/](https://github.com/victor-fancelli-capdevila/abc_dl/). Note the difference between the aspect and the link in the repository and the website where content is displayed, which is victor-fancelli-capdevila.github.io/abc_dl/ (github.io in the middle vs a github.com at the beginning). For archive or documentation purposes of the course, we may make a copy of the repository, with all the data in it.

### We offer alternatives to GitHub
The project is (also) a course in the HfG Karlsruhe, which is also providing services that you may use for making a contribution as an alternative to GitHub. Two plattforms are especially relevant: Moodle, where we use the [Moodle of the course](https://moodle.hfg-karlsruhe.de/course/view.php?id=744) and Nextcloud, where you can [joint the circle of the course and get access to our Shared folder](https://cloud.hfg-karlsruhe.de/apps/contacts/circle/5brS9N1EiZj2wMFQawiStcUORcMjVUb).

Both plattforms are used as a preparation for publishing materials or for sharing and discussing, and follows the same principles of other projects or courses in the university (which define the framework how far the materials in the plattforms can be stored for documentation or archival purposes). We did not find any specific privacy policy for the instance of these plattforms, so we assume, we are under the [general privacy policy of the HfG Karlsruhe](https://hfg-karlsruhe.de/datenschutz/).
