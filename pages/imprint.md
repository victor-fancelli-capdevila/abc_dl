> This is a translation of the [German Impressum]({{site.baseurl}}/_de/imprint), for information purposes only. Although every effort has been made to make the translation as accurate as possible, the legal interpretation of this translation could generate misunderstandings. Should this be the case, we encourage you to write to us to correct the translation and urge, in case of conflict, to take the original German document as a reference.

## Notice according to the Online Dispute Resolution Regulation

Under applicable law, we are obliged to inform consumers of the existence of the European Online Dispute Resolution platform, which can be used to resolve disputes without having to go to court. The European Commission is responsible for setting up the platform. The European Online Dispute Resolution Platform can be found here: [http://ec.europa.eu/odr](http://ec.europa.eu/odr). Our email is: vfcapdevila@hfg-karlsruhe.de

However, we would like to point out that we are not willing to participate in the dispute resolution procedure under the European Online Dispute Resolution Platform. To contact us, please use our email and phone number above.

## Disclaimer—legal information
### § 1 Content warning

The free and freely accessible contents of this website have been created with the greatest possible care. However, the provider of this website does not guarantee the accuracy and actuality of the provided guides and news. Contributions identified by author name reflect the opinion of the respective author and not always the opinion of the provider. Calling up the free and freely accessible content alone does not establish any contractual relationship between the user and the provider; in this respect, the provider's intention to be legally bound is lacking.

### § 2 External links
This website contains links to third-party websites (“external links”). These websites are subject to the liability of the respective operators. When the external links were first created, the provider checked the external content for any legal violations. At that time, no legal violations were apparent. The provider has no influence on the current and future design and content of the linked pages. The inclusion of external links does not imply that the provider adopts the content behind the reference or link as its own. It is not reasonable for the provider to constantly monitor the external links without concrete evidence of legal violations. However, such external links will be deleted immediately if legal violations become known.

### § 3 Copyrights and ancillary copyrights
The content published on this website is subject to German copyright and ancillary copyright law. Any use not permitted by German copyright and ancillary copyright law requires the prior written consent of the provider or the respective rights' holder. This applies in particular to the copying, editing, translation, storage, processing, or reproduction of content in databases or other electronic media and systems. Contents and rights of third parties are marked as such. The unauthorized reproduction or distribution of individual content or complete pages is not permitted and is punishable by law. Only the production of copies and downloads for personal, private and non-commercial use is permitted.

The display of this website in external frames is only permitted with written permission.

### § 4 Special terms of use
Insofar as special conditions for individual uses of this website deviate from the aforementioned paragraphs, this will be expressly pointed out at the appropriate place. In this case, the special terms of use apply in each individual case.

# Privacy Policy

> A Privacy policy is a legal document in which we describes how we process data, especially personal data. In Germany, as part of the EU, it's regulated by [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu). Even if our aim is not to store or process personal data information, we may need to do it, hence our privacy policy. "Personal data" is defined as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’)" (Art. 4.1) and "processing" as "any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction" (Art. 4.2).

To be clear about our privacy policy ([Art 12 of GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/)), we need to differentiate two cases: Navigating through the website and contributing to the website

## Navigating through the website
By navigating through the website, we are referring to the activities (mainly accessing information) in [https://victor-fancelli-capdevila.github.io/abc_dl/](https://victor-fancelli-capdevila.github.io/abc_dl/) or subpages that have something after /abc_dl/, for example, [our imprint page at https://victor-fancelli-capdevila.github.io/abc_dl/imprint.html](https://victor-fancelli-capdevila.github.io/abc_dl/imprint.html).

Important here is:

### We don't track or profile you
We don't track or profile you in any way, nor we display ads or use this information to “improve our website”: If you think that we should improve something, make a contribution, open an issue or write us an email. That's precisely what we are trying to achieve with this website.

### We don't send any newsletter, we don't have any social media profile
So, we don't have to worry about it in our privacy policy. The website is also not connected with any social media. Again, if you want something, write us.

### Forms in our website do not save personal data
You may encounter some forms on the website, for example a search bar or checkboxes: they do not save or send any information (nor personal or any other information) to us.

### Let's talk about (internet) cookies
Internet cookies are small files that your browser may download from a website and save in your computer or device, with some of your preferences or information to facilitate your navigation. When you navigate through the internet, other websites may see your cookies, and through them profiling you (recognizing you as a particular user or as part of a target group).

We don't use internet cookies, but you can manage or deactivate cookies in your browser (Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Brave, Internet Explorer or Edge, etc.), normally under preferences, security, and privacy or something like that. We may use other cookies, as, but not limited to, chocolate cookies, but that's out of the scope of this document.

## Contributing to the website
By making a contribution to the website, we understand that you share any kind of information with us with the aim to be published. To achieve that, you may use different platforms (GitHub, moodle, or Nextcloud hosted in the university) that may use cookies or store your personal information. Check with them about their data policies.

### Check what you share with us: it will go public
We encourage you to check that the material you share with us does not contain any personal information that you don't want to make publicly available (that's especially relevant if you take screenshots). Even if we will check and modify (remove, obfuscate, etc.) that you are not sharing unnecessary personal data in the contents, it's your responsibility.

### The name of the contributor, the (only) personal data we're interested in
If you make a contribution, we will ask you to provide a name (it can be your full name, first name, a nickname, etc.), that we can put in our published list of contributors. The aim of this list is to show who contribute in this website, a kind of acknowledgment or recognition. There is no obligation in filling your name in the list: It's completely free, and you can edit this list at any moment, or write us to do so. This data will remain published until you indicated the contrary or until the project is abandoned.

### We use GitHub, and they have their privacy policies
We use GitHub Inc. or GitHub B.V. for managing version control of the contributions and hosting the website. [Here you can check the privacy policies of GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies). GitHub will save some personal information data, and you should contact them if you have any issue or question.

Their data policy is valid when you are in the  [GitHub project's repository, which is https://github.com/victor-fancelli-capdevila/abc_dl/](https://github.com/victor-fancelli-capdevila/abc_dl/). Note the difference between the aspect and the link in the repository and the website where content is displayed, which is victor-fancelli-capdevila.github.io/abc_dl/ (GitHub.io in the middle vs. a GitHub.com at the beginning). For archive or documentation purposes of the course, we may make a copy of the repository, with all the data in it.

### We offer alternatives to GitHub (with their policies too)
The project is (also) a course in the HfG Karlsruhe, which is also providing services that you may use for making a contribution as an alternative to GitHub. Two platforms are especially relevant: Moodle, where we use the [Moodle of the course](https://moodle.hfg-karlsruhe.de/course/view.php?id=744) and Nextcloud, where you can [joint the circle of the course and get access to our shared folder](https://cloud.hfg-karlsruhe.de/apps/contacts/circle/5brS9N1EiZj2wMFQawiStcUORcMjVUb).

Both platforms are used as a preparation for publishing materials or for sharing and discussing, and follow the same principles of other projects or courses in the university (which define the framework how far the materials in the platforms can be stored for documentation or archival purposes). We did not find any specific privacy policy for the instance of these platforms, so we assume, we are under the [general privacy policy of the HfG Karlsruhe](https://hfg-karlsruhe.de/datenschutz/).

### What happens to emails you are sending to us?
I normally save a big part of emails people are sending to me, specially if I consider them to be important or funny. I will not further process these emails, just having them there makes me happy. Furthermore, I may use part of your emails to create content, anonymizing you or asking your permission to refer to you. If for any reason you want your emails deleted, send an email and I will check, but I am afraid that we may enter a loop of you asking me to delete previous emails forever. There is also the possibility that you want me to delete your email before reading and evaluating whether I want to preserve it or not: I am not aware of any specific tool that can accommodate this desire, except of not sending the email…

# Disclaimer

Yes, there are some rights we would like to reserve (one never knows what will happen tomorrow):

§ 1 The authors and contributors of this website have the right (but not the obligation), on November 3rd, Digital Preservation Day, to print all the protected data provided to them, strip it in small pieces while invoking the whatever spirits, gods or demons they like, as long as after doing it, they burn the pieces of paper in a big fire singing and dancing (naked or not) frenetically.

§ 2 The authors and contributors of this website are explicitly allowed to perform the acts detailed in § 1 even if it's not on November 3rd as long as one of the conditions is meet: a) there is a full moon; b) there is an agreement between all participants to move the day of the ritual; c) someone had a tough day d) none of the above.

§ 3 The authors and contributors of this website want to make explicit their refusal to Minuet in general, even for acts described on § 1. Nonetheless, if, for whatever reason they consider that other types of music acceptable as (but not limited to) iambic, gigues, sarabands or reggaeton pieces are not fitting their mood, they explicitly reserve the right to exceptionally allow minuets, wigs and false warts during the celebration of the acts described in § 1.

# A note on GDPR transparency
[Article 12.1 of GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/) requires us to have this information concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible. We tried our best to have it concise, intelligible and easy accessible, but we stroke to make it transparent, which in our humble experience would make it less easy to read. [Recital 58, called “The principle of Transparency”](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-58/) repeats the ideas on Article 12 without providing a clear definition of what is meant by transparency:

> The principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language and, additionally, where appropriate, visualisation be used.


After a long reflection, we decided, as the Information page we consulted, to put the information black on white because it seems the better way to make it accessible. We were afraid of going against the law, so in the best of our intentions, we offer a complete transparent version of the privacy policy after clicking this button:

<button onclick="makeTransparent()">Make it transparent</button>

<script>
// Create a commutator to activate or deactivate transparency
var com = 0;
function makeTransparent() {
  // Activate transparency
  if (com == 0) {
    document.getElementsByClassName("td-content")[0].setAttribute("style","color:transparent;");
    com = 1;
  // deactivate if it's already active
  } else {
    document.getElementsByClassName("td-content")[0].setAttribute("style","color:black;");
    com = 0;
  };
}
</script>
