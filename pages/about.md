# About

This website was created as part of the mateirals of the course "The abc of Digital Literacy" which took place in the Karlsruhe Univeristy of Arts and Design during the Winter semester 22/23 and is available to everyone: even if the infrastructure of a small univeristy near the black forest may not be not so interesting, we wanted to share our approach in teaching digital tools, digital competence, etc.

The goals of the course was to familiarize students with digital tools offered by the university, as well as a more general approach toward digitality: consulting and writing documentation (more on this in the course). For this we create a recusive approach: 

The decision to create this webseite was influenced by the following facts:
* The impossibility/difficulty of exporting contents from moodle (which would have made impossible to recycle this materials for other semesters)
* The lack of documentation of the tools in the university
* The incredible amount of creativy among students

If you are reading this, you may wonder why we have not used a wiki, which makes part of this process easier. Well, a wiki needs more maintenace and right now we can not guarantee it: for this reason seems more reasonable to work with Jekyll and Morkdown: interoperability and the possibility to "save" and export the project. On the other hand, the difficulties that git implies should also be as a challenge in a context like ours.
