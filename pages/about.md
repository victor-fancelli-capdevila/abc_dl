# About

This website was created as part of the materials of the course "The abc of Digital Literacy" which took place in the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design during the Winter semester 22/23 and is available to everyone: even if the infrastructure of a small university near the black forest may not be not so interesting, we wanted to share our approach in teaching digital tools, digital competence, etc.
