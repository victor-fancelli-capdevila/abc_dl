# How to Website

> Hi,
I've been trying to create a website to show my work, using wordpress, but it has been a very frustrating experience so far since it seems the platform won't let me customize anything unless I pay many $$$.
Do you have any advice or can you point me towards a better direction to create a personalized and efficient website ? Does one always has to pay to make a website ? How do I free myself from the corporate world and create something of my own ?
I hope these questions make sense,

I'm really happy to have a question! And it's actually a good one. Short answer: I'm not aware of any system of having a website that you can modify at cost zero, but this does not necessaryly means that you cannot afford the costs. Ambiguos enought? Let's go for the long answer, then!

## You need (at least) three things to have webiste
A webpage it's a document hosted by a computer (let's call it computer 1) and served to another one (let's call this, in a tour the force of immagination, computer 2) through a network. Computer 1 hosts (in the sense "is the house of", "is were it lives or where it's stored") the website and serves it to computer 2: that's why we may refer to computer one as host, hosting or server (because it serves the webpage, more on that in a minute), and computer 2 is often called a client computer (because client's are always right? or maybe because master would have another connotationt). The coputer client have to reach the server and request the website. In other words we need

1. A Document(s): The webpage(s) itself
2. A host or a server where this document is stored
3. A direction of the host that the client can reach

And of course a client with someone willing to reach your website. We assume that you have someone

### The Document(s): The webpage(s) itself
Create a .txt document and open it with your browser (yes, it does not look good, but you can do that). Even more, if you put this documetn in a shared folder (a folder shared with your internal network) others may also open it in the browser (or in a .txt editor). You could consider that a webiste, but it gets interesting if insted of a .txt you get a .html file.

Websites are normally written in HTML (HyperTextual Markup Language): it's a Markup Language because it uses tags (<tag>element</tag>) to define every element: a header of level one (the title), a section title (header 2), normal text and so on. And HyperTextual it's something preatty cool that blow up the mind of some literature critics (and not only): documents may connect with other documents, for example through a link that you can click on to access the other documents. And thay may be connected with other documents that specify how each of this elements should look like (.css) or programm some reactions to the user interaction (javascript). There are lots of websites where you can learn HTML, CSS and Javascript probably the reference one is [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).

Even if you could pack everything in the same document, normally there are different files, connected through the html (that makes everything easier). A Browser (Firefox, Chromium etc, whatever you are reding this website through) is capable of request an html file from a server (we will talk about it later) and all the other connected files and displey the content in html following the indications of the aspect of each element (css) and possible interactions (javascript). It's not common to build a website directly in HTML: with all the tags in the middle, it's not really practical and everything will be messy in short time, even for people that works with HTML.
Take our website as an example: it makes no sense that everytime I'm writing a new post I copy-paste that on top left there should appear "The abc of digital literacy". It's a process easy to automatize once divided in small pieces: for every website I will create, please put the abc of digital literacy for me.

Content Management System (as the one in Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, etc) facilitates this puzzeling of pieces and normally offers an interface thought for people not familiar with all this. The advantage of this simplified user interfaces is simplification but the disadvantage it's also simplification: sometimes you may need long workarounds to be able that the webpage do exactly what you want, but if you are in the foreseen workflow everything will be rally easy. We are using jekyll, where everything it's not so easy at the beginning, but allows us lot of possibilities to change things (and make the hosting part easier).

There are a lot of CMS out there divided in two big groups: Static websites, in which all the pieces are mounted and delivered togheter and dynamic websites, in which all the pieces are stored in a database and the server ensambles the pieces of the needed website everytime it recieves a request. The theory is that small easy websites works and are easy maintained with statics, and more complex need dynamic website. Don't overthing this: if the difference really metters for your project, you should be working with someone that can help you with this decision.

How to choose a "good" CMS? That's really complicated because it depends on lot's of things: The better you know your skills or define what you expect on your website, the easier it will be. Search what other people is using when confronted with a similar problem as yours and/or talk to your friends. And don't let the 0-euro seduce you: normally that's just the entrance to a limited version and some features you may want will be in the paid version (there's nothing bad in fairly prize versions by the way!).


### A direction of the host that the client can reach
You have a website in your computer, but how could you reach it? Obviously accessing somehow your computer throught a network. The common way would be using the IP Adress: a combination of numbers similar to a telephone. Every time you connect to a Network (Wi-Fi or with cable) the router will assign you, as all the other connected devices a number (a classical: 192.168.1.X in which x is your device). You can reach other devices in the network through this number, as in internal telephone systems, where you only mark the extension (actually, in networks you are able also to call yourself).

That's great, but normally the world you are interested in is in other networks: Then you exit your network (which is connected with other networks), signal in which network you want to connect and which extension you want to reach. Could you imagine that? Having to remember the number of google? or the number of your favorite webiste? We will need a huge telephone guide (actually, Daniel Temkin played with this idea in [_Internet directory_](https://zkm.de/de/ausstellung/2017/10/open-codes/katalog/internet-directory), 2018).

Luclily we have another approach, based on Domain Name System. Basically some top level domains were established: generic, managed by the [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)](https://www.icann.org/) e.g. .com(munication), .net(work), .info(rmation), .org(anization), .edu(cation) etc. or based in country codes, managed by the respective countries (.de, .us, .es). Often this domains are managed by a fundation that establishes the bases to accept a website or not in their domain: normally are not so exigent, but if you want to hhve an .edu website you should demostrate that you're connected to education or if you want a .cat domain that your website is in catalan or somehow connected to catalan culture; for a .de website, you should have an impressum, as your website will be under German laws.

You probably want to buy a domain for your website and connect to the ip of the computer that hosts your website. You could also have a subdomain, but that may be complicated, as well as using the subdomain provided by the hosting service (more on that, later). Searching around you will find probably some top-domains chepaer that others and prizes may vary depending on the domain provider and the offers that apply.

One last thing to consider is if you want a Dynamic or Static DNS: that depends basically on the hosting system you want to set up. For a classical hosting service, a static dns will be enought. A Dynamic DNS make sense if you plan to host your website in a home server, that is connected with e.g. your home network. The IP adress that you have at home may change without you noticing it (becasue you normally go out of this network or connect to devices in the same network): that's a problem if someone from outside is trying to reach a computer in your network. Dynamic DNS updates with your new IP Adress everytime it changes.


(Not so) Funny fact: Our website is hosted under .io domain, which is a country code for British Indian Ocean Territory, an archipielago in the Indian Ocean claimed by Mauritius and part of the Overseas Territory of United Kingdom. Due to the similarity with I/O (Input Output) was appreciated and used by informatics and GitHub. [More on this fascinating story in the Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.io)

### The host or a server where this document is stored
Until now we have a website and one direction, but where is the website actually stored?

Your fist thought may be: Well, actually in my laptop. You need to configure it as a server: not impossible, but also not so easy, and what is worse: I would not recommend that. Well, I would recommend for some uses, as checking how your website looks like but you will be using a probably 1000€ machine to do what a 60€ machine could do.

And even worse: Every time your laptop is shut down, your webpage will not be reachable. Or everytime you change the network you should reconfigure the DNS. not to talk about potential risks of having in the same machine data you want to share (your website) and data you don't want to share (the rest of data in your computer).

That's way we refer to servers as something different of computerts, even if they're really similar. When we talk about servers, we normally intend big computers designed to do stay all the time on and with hardware specifications focused on the use (no fancy grafic cards, but a lot of RAM). For hosting companies it's easy to maintain less big computers that a lot of small ones, and hecne their virtualize. Often the servers are really huge computers virtualized: even if everything is phisically in the same computer, every virtual computer operates as it will be separated from the other neighbours (it will sound familiar if you have seen _The Matrix_). When you ask for a hosting service, you normally get a virtual machine you can acess and you will have no contact with your "neighbours".

You can serach some hosting providers in internet, and decide which one feeds better with your principles and your project. Some of them offer hosting with already isntalled CMS. We're particularly impressed by the approach of uberspace, a company with excellent documentation and that give you the power to do whatever you want in your space.

Or you can take another approach as the [Solar.Lowtechmagazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/) and install your website in a Raspberry Pi (not your laptop) and use it a server for your website, powered by a solar paner. [Here is the How-To](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html#how).


## How we (tryied to) solve this problem

Our Hosting Provider is GitHub, which makes easy to integrate the development part. As an environment (or CMS, but would be complex to call it so) we're using Jekyll, a static website generator. We have a copy of the website in our computer, in which we create new entries or edit the older ones (also considering the nextcloud version of the files). To do it, we have a jekyll in our computer so we can see what we are changing (is creating the website after every change). When we're happy with the changes, we push them to the GitHub repository, i.e. we upload the files to GitHub. When this happends, GitHub, asks Jekyll to create the static website from the modified files and serves to the website you're seeing. The domain you get with gitHub is not so nice, but it will work: for some money you may have a domain, but you could also live without it.

In conclusion: one way of making websites without paying money and with a resonable limit is to learn Jekyll and using Github (you may also GitLab). It's not so easy but it's not impossible... and we're here to help you if you found any diffulties.
