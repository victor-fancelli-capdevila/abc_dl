> This crash course is aimed at all those people (beginners or not, students or not) who want to learn about and get the most of the digital infrastructure offered by HfG. It is a warm-up to face the new semester and get the digital part ready and well tempered: we will talk about how to search and find help, how to document and configure eduroam (WiFi), the Mail (and use the filters critically) and the exchange and much more (forms, calendars, etc.) platform Nextcloud, as well as Moodle and BigBlueButton. All this, with hands-on approach, so get up, stand up and bring your laptops!
This is an early-bird course: it runs during the semester's opening week (Monday 17, Wednesday 19, Thursday 20 October) and the following week (Monday 24, Tuesday 25 October), from 9am to 10am. Details of each session will be available on Moodle.

# Pedagogical approach
> From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs

- Spark sessions, DIY (at your rhythm), during the whole semester
- No exams, no attendance obligation, no certificates: only your pure interest
