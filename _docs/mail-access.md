There are different ways of accessing your E-Mail at the HfG: Through horde, Nextcloud and an Email-Client
<!-- more -->

## Through Horde
Go to [webmail.hfg-karlsruhe.de](https://webmail.hfg-karlsruhe.de) and log in with your username (without @hfg-kalrsruhe.de) and password.
For a long time (you can see that in the interface), this has been the main access to E-Mail for the HfG community, so a lot of people may refer to this Webmail when they speak as the "Mail of the HfG".

There are two text fields (username and password) and two dropdown fields: Mode which is set in automatic and Language which is set in English (American). After that a black login button with a locker next to it.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/docs/mail-horde-login.png)



## Through HfG-Cloud
Go to [cloud.hfg-karlsruhe.de](https://cloud.hfg-karlsruhe.de) and log in with username **with @hfg-karlsruhe.de** and password. This is the Mail integrated in the cloud, and that is its main advantage (that you have it together with shared calendars and files). One of the main advantages is that the configuration is made out of the box, and you only need some tuning.

## Through an E-Mail Client

> An E-Mail client is a program installed in your computer that synchronizes a Mail folder in your computer with the one in the server. Normally is practical, because allow a better integration in your computer and allows you to work without be dependent on an internet connection.

You need an E-Mail Client installed on your Desktop. Lots of Operating System offer a mail client (AppleMail, Outlook, Evolution, etc.). If you search a easy, modular and free (as in gratis and as in Mozilla Public License) E-Mail client for all platforms, we recommend [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/download/); for Android devices, [K9 -Mail](https://k9mail.app/download). Check below the instructions for configuring it.
