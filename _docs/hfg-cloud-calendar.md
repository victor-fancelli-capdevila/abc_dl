Calendars of the HfG cloud allow to create, configure and share a calendar with other people (and allow them to see and or to edit them). But they actually allow to do a lot of other things.

By default, you will have one calendar called "Personal" for you and you will see all the calendars shared with you.

The documentation on Nextcloud seems to be quite reach so we will only copy things that work different for us and show a scheme of links. Let's first have an overview:

Here some cool features you had probably though "The HfG chould have an app for that":
