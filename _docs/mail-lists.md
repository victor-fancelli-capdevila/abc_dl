> An Email list is simply a list of Email addresses under a name. You can send an E-Mail to different E-Mail addresses or save them in an E-Mail list, which will prevent forgetting to send the Email to someone.

You can create your own Email-List and save it on your address book, or you can use the public Email Lists provided by the HfG.

In [accounts.hfg-karlsruhe.de](https://acconuts.hfg-karlsruhe.de) after login in with your full name and Family name you can see which lists are available, who is in which lists and who administrate this lists. If you need an extra list everyone in the HfG should have access to, contact the IT department.
Classical lists include all the students, all the academic staff, all professors, all members of a department, etc.

It would be great if someone could make a van diagram of the different Email lists...
