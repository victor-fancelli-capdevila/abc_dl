# Eduroam

## What is eduroam (and why I need it)?
According to [eduroam.org](https://eduroam.org/what-is-eduroam/ "Link to eduroam"):

> eduroam (education roaming) is the secure, world-wide roaming access service developed for the international research and education community.<br/><br/>
eduroam allows students, researchers and staff from participating institutions to obtain Internet connectivity across campus and when visiting other participating institutions by simply opening their laptop.

In other words, it's an authentication by which all university members can access Wi-Fi of other universities worldwide. So, if you are travelling, you can go to a university (library) and enjoy free (and fast) Wi-Fi.


## Installation and configuration
More information available information here: [http://accounts.hfg-karlsruhe.de](http://accounts.hfg-karlsruhe.de "Accounts website of the HfG") after login in.

### Windows 10 & 11
 > Windows installation is a bit tricky, but we have this step-by-step guide.

Open the Windows Settings (Einstellungen) of you Computer.
![Step-1-Einstellungen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116261175/196897447-32368d07-c1f4-4df1-a48a-34832c8b9032.png)

Go to Network and Internet (Netzwerk und Internet) and there to Wi-Fi (WLAN).


![Step-2-WLAN](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116261175/196897543-8702025c-07eb-408d-b5b2-23e1aff7fb5c.png)

When you klick on Managing known Networks (Bekannte Netzwerke verwalten) a list of network names will appear. Klick on eduroam. Then the option forget (nicht speichern) will show. Klick forget (nicht speichern) to delete eduroam. Don't worry, you'll get it back in a second.

![Step-3-Nicht-Speichern](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116261175/196897567-4a0b596d-1ac3-429a-b06c-20e1a5dfedd5.png)

On the Windows Menu (or Windows-key), search for Panel Control (Systemsteuerung), and there click on Network and Internet (Netzwerke und Internet). Now you should see something like:

![Screenshot of the Network and internet section of Panel control](../assets/img/docs/eduroam-windows-02.png)

Now click on "Create new connection or new network" (Neue Verbinung oder neues Netzwerk einrichten). This will appear:

![The window for creating a connection or a network, offering the possibiliy to choose between four options: an arrow signaling the world globe to establish a connection with internet; An arrow pointing a network computer in a pipe, for creating a new Network. The computer in a pipe, but without arrow for creating a manual wi-fi connection; finally an icon of a rack to establish a connection with the workspace. At the bottom on the right, two buttons to continue or cancel the process.](../assets/img/docs/eduroam-windows-03.png)

Yes, all the options seems quite similar, but you want the third one (establish Manual connection to a wireless network?), and hence we selected it. This will appear:

![Screenshot of ](../assets/img/docs/eduroam-windows-04.png)

The name should be "eduroam" or "eduroam-hfg" (no matter if you're using uppercase) and WPA2-Enterprise. Click on next.

Now the tricky part: You will come back to the Panel control and the first link allows us to change the configuration (or something like that). Yes, it makes no sense, Windows: assuming we started a manual configuration, and you didn't give any possibility to configure itâ€¦ Yes, we want to change the configuration you automatically created. After clicking on the link, something like that should appear (don't worry if your data is different):

![](../assets/img/docs/eduroam-windows-06.png)

Just ignore it and go to the "Security" tab. We can check the first part from our checklist:
- [x] WPA2-Enterprise
- [X] AES
Now select `Microsoft: EAP-TTLS` from the dropdown menu and then click on `Configuration`, which looks like:

![](../assets/img/docs/eduroam-windows-07.png)

Please check that everything is correct

- [ ] Anonymity protection checkbox is activated
- [ ] Anonymity Identity is `anonymous@hfg-karlsruhe.de`
- [ ] Connection to server is set to `radius.hfg-karlsruhe.de`
- [ ] You checked the T-TeleSec Global Root Certificate (you should check in the list)
- [ ] Check also the thing after that
- [ ] Check the EAP-(External?) Authentication method and set to PAP (sometimes this and the next appear to change positions...)

Click on Ok, after the configuration. Small yeah! We still need a couple of things. So, we're back in the Security tab:

![](../assets/img/docs/eduroam-windows-06.png)

and we want to click in Advanced Options:

![](../assets/img/docs/eduroam-windows-08.png)

Here, you want to have the first checkbox activated, and select User-Authentication. Then click on the button after it, "Save Log-in information", this will happen:

![](../assets/img/docs/eduroam-windows-09.png)

- **Login**: your username (everything before @hfg-karlsruhe.de)
- **Password**: the E-Mail password.

Click ok.
Now you can go to the wireless symbol in the bar and try to connect normally. It may ask you again log-in and password, and then it should work.

So, congratulations, now you have internet (almost) everywhere!
