# The HfG Card

The HfG Card was completely implemented during before the start of the WS 2022/2023, while both the old analogue and Student ID card (you needed to stamp every semester) and the Chip key were retired. Both elements had great popularity among the community, and even a gold version of the chip key was made as a recognition to some distinguished members.

If you are a student the ID card can be used to prove that you are a student (and get discount in theater or museums, or not paying in the public transport during weekends or from 18:00 to 6:00).

In any case, the card is configured with the rooms to which you have access that may change in time. All the information here collected and translate comes from different emails send to the community.

## Getting a HfG Card

The official way seems to be writing an email to: zugang@hfg-karlsruhe.de.

If you need to access the building during the night or the weekend, the form you require is
an [Antrag auf Nacht- bzw. Wochenendegenehmigung](https://hfg-karlsruhe.de/hochschule/downloads/181206_nacht-wochenendgenehmigung_formular.pdf)

## Updating the card in the terminal
Once someone provides you access, you need to update your card. There is an ITT Terminal (also referred as charging station) in one column, near the turnstile door from the Lorenzstraße. You need to gently lean your card until you will hear a beep, and you will see a green light. If you hear more beeps and the lights are red, it means that was not updated. Try again.

# How does the ITT (Intelligent Transponder Terminal) work?

The ITT has four light-emitting diodes, please hold your chip card as a locking medium with light contact to the ITT for about two seconds, the horizontal version is preferable to the vertical version because then you have the four light-emitting diodes in view. If the lowest two of the four LEDs turn green, and you hear an acoustic signal, your chip card has been successfully programmed. If these LEDs turn red, please repeat the process because the programming was not successful. This does not affect the functionality of your locking medium.

# How does the system work? Is secure? Can someone track me?

There has been some discussion on these issues, but tools to check the security of the system were never provided, so we have no answer.
