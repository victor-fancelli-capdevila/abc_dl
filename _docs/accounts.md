# Getting a HfG Account

The IT Department of the university will create an account for you, that you can use to log-in to all the digital services of the university.

The IT is in Room 333, in the 3rd floor, on the South-West part of the building. You can also get in contact with them per <a href="mailto:support@hfg-karlsruhe.de" aria-label="Sent an Email to support@hfg-karlsruhe.de">Email</a>

# Changing the password

You can change your password account in the Accounts Management System (AMS) that you can find in [accounts.hfg-karlsruhe.de](accounts.hfg-karlsruhe.de)
You will find an interface like this:

![The log-in Interface of Account Management System (AMS) of the HfG. There is a Grey Rectangle with a text in German, explaining that here you can change your password. After that there is a blue text link to webmail.hfg-karlsruhe.de.  Outside of the rectangle, three textfields for login: Vorname (Name), Nachname (Family name) and Password, with a white button on the bottom for Anmelden, login]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/docs/ams-login.png)

To log in you need to enter your name, family name and your actual password, exactly as introduced when your account was created.

> There may be empty spaces (for double names or family names), as well as accents, umlauts or dash.

After that you will find something like this:

![Screenshot of the Accounts Management System, in German. In the top, a grey bar, with different options. In the middle, two panels with big numbers: on the left, the panel with number one offers the possibility of selecting the password with two textfields (new password, repeat password); on the right, number 2, ask to select the account, offering, in checkboxes: all accounts, AMS Account (with a small blue icon of a question mark), Moodle/Fileserver; After that the title E-Mail Accounts and blurred a checkbox; At the bottom the 3rd option, save, have a big blue button]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/docs/ams-changing-password.png)

It's pretty clear what the system expect you to do:

1. Write twice your password in the left panel with a 1
2. Control for which accounts you want to change the passwords
3. Save it

You're done!
