# What is eduroam?
According to [eduroam.org](https://eduroam.org/what-is-eduroam/ "Link to eduroam.org website"):

> eduroam (education roaming) is the secure, world-wide roaming access service developed for the international research and education community.<br/><br/>
eduroam allows students, researchers and staff from participating institutions to obtain Internet connectivity across campus and when visiting other participating institutions by simply opening their laptop.

In other words, it's an authentication by which all university members can access Wi-Fi of universities worldwide. So, if you are traveling, you can go to a university (library) and enjoy free (and fast) Wi-Fi.

# eduroam in the HfG

If you are in the building, your device may detect two Wi-Fi connections:

- **eduroam**
- **eduroam-hfg**

The reason for this two eduroams is that ZKM is also offering an internet connection through eduroam, but some people need to know in which of the networks (HfG or ZKM) they are. Other users in the building may not experience any relevant difference between both networks, as they use the same hardware, offer the same speed, etc.

In short:
> Configure Eduroam (it will allow connecting into other institutions). Configure also eduroam-hfg  only if you need to be sure you are connecting to the hfg network.
