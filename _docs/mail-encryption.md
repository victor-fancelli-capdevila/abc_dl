## Encryption
Encryption of Emails is a way of assuring that only the sender and the receiver of the Email can read the Email information (for some people this can be a vital issue). Remember that there are always two parts in the communication (sender and receiver): hence is important to allow encryption even if you don't plan to use it, so that others (whos mail is less ) can send you encrypted messages.
